# EnjoyTheOutdoors


## Overall description

HTML, Bootstrap, CSS and JavaScript are the foundations of this website. It is a search directory website for national parks.

My website has a navbar located at the top of each page and a footer at the bottom which remains consistent throughout every page:

Index/Home: a carousel is present upon first entering the homepage with links to the other pages.There is a small 'About Us' and 'Questions?' section.

National Parks Search: a fully functional JavaScript integrated page which allows you to select between two dropdowns to search by location or park type.

Mountain Information: a fully functional JavaScript integrated page which allows you to select a dropdown to seach by mountain.

## Describe one piece of code

The output for the Mountain Info page vs the National Parks Search page: the difference in using a card vs not (go in depth during presentation).
