## Overall description

HTML, Bootstrap, CSS and JavaScript are the foundations of this website. It is a search directory website for national parks.

My website has a navbar located at the top of each page and a footer at the bottom which remains consistent throughout every page:

Index/Home: a carousel is present upon first entering the homepage with links to the other pages.There is a small 'About Us' and 'Questions?' section.
